🏠 Task-01: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as:

Square Footage

Number of Bedrooms

Number of Bathrooms


The model aims to provide a simple yet effective approach for understanding how these features affect housing prices.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle. It contains comprehensive housing data, including numerical and categorical features.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

NumPy & Pandas

Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)


📊 Model Objective

Predict the SalePrice of houses using:

GrLivArea (Above ground living area in square feet)

BedroomAbvGr (Number of bedrooms above ground)

FullBath (Number of full bathrooms)


🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository.


2. Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.


4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.



📈 Sample Output

Visualizations showing the relationship between features and price

R² score and RMSE to evaluate model performance


🧠 Future Work

Include more features for better accuracy

Explore advanced models (Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost)         give me the code github format so that there are no error.
